### About Me :

Let me introduce myself,

I'm Sai Mandadapu, a passionate Data Engineering and Analytics enthusiast, recently graduated from Northeastern University with master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering. I am excited to embark on the next chapter of my journey in the dynamic world of Data Science. I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills and knowledge to drive meaningful insights and actionable solutions. If you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic team member who is eager to contribute and learn, I'd love to connect!

### 👨🏻‍💻 Work Experience :

With over 4 years of work experience in the field of Data Engineering and Analytics, I bring a wealth of practical knowledge and expertise to the table. Over the years, I've honed my skills in both data engineering, ensuring robust data pipelines and infrastructure, and data analysis, uncovering valuable insights to drive informed decision-making. My journey in the realm of data began with a fascination for unraveling complex patterns and extracting actionable insights from raw datasets. 

I've designed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to seamlessly ingest data from diverse sources, ensuring data quality and integrity throughout the pipelines and well-versed in leveraging tools like Hadoop, Spark, Databricks, Airflow, and Kafka to process and analyze massive datasets in distributed computing environments.
Proficient in data modeling methods for optimized databases and warehouse to efficiently store and retrieve large volumes of data.
Strong experience with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, managing data pipelines, data security compliance on cloud environments.

I'm adept at applying statistical methods and hypothesis testing to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within data. Skilled in using visualization tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and communicated the insights effectively and intuitively to stakeholders. Built machine learning models, to develop predictive models and algorithms to solve business problems using Scikit-learn, Tensorflow.

At the core of my professional ethos lies a deep-seated passion for solving complex problems. Whether it's optimizing data pipelines for efficiency, uncovering hidden patterns in datasets, or devising innovative solutions to business challenges, I thrive in environments that present intellectual challenges and opportunities for creative problem-solving.

### 📊 Academic Projects :

During my academic tenure, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that span the spectrum of Data Analytics. From predictive modeling and statistical analysis to data visualization and optimization techniques, each project has provided invaluable insights and hands-on experience. Some notable projects include:

- [Credit card default classification](https://github.com/saichandureddy/Credit-Card-Default-Classification): In this project, developed SVM, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression machine learning models from scratch to classify the risk of credit card holders fall into default. Performed statistical analysis to perform feature engineering and visualized the insights through seaborna dn matplotlib libraries.
- [Flight Price Prediction](https://github.com/saichandureddy/Flight-Price-Prediction): In this project we analyzed the flight prices dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to dicover the hidden patterns, outliers, correlated features that affecting the price. Created visualizations to compare the features and its realtion to target variable.
- [Liver Cirrhosis Classification](https://github.com/saichandureddy/Liver-Cirrhosis-Classification): Analyzed th patient health records and classified the stages liver disease in the patient. Implemented Random forest, decision tree, logistic regression machine learning models to classify the different levels of risk of being effected by liver disease.
