### About Me :

Let me introduce myself,

I'm Sai Chandra Reddy Mandadapu, a Data Analyst with a master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering from Northeastern University. I currently work in marketing analytics, retail, and customer insights, leveraging data to deliver meaningful insights and support business decisions. Passionate about continuous learning, I am focused on upskilling in advanced analytics, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to grow into new roles and take on greater challenges.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Work Experience :

With over 4 years of experience in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic business decisions. My expertise spans the full analytics lifecycle — from gathering and preparing data, to analysis, visualization, and communicating results to stakeholders.

I have designed and maintained ETL processes to integrate data from diverse sources, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Skilled in data modeling for optimized reporting and dashboard performance, I work extensively with SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to deliver impactful visual analytics.

My analytical toolkit includes statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and identifying patterns and trends that inform decision-making. I leverage Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for deeper exploration, and have experience applying predictive modeling techniques to support business forecasting.

With a strong background in marketing analytics, retail analytics, and customer insights, I focus on connecting data to business goals. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with stakeholders, solve complex problems, and create data-driven solutions that generate measurable impact.


### 📊 Academic Projects :

During my academic tenure, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that span the spectrum of Data Analytics. From predictive modeling and statistical analysis to data visualization and optimization techniques, each project has provided invaluable insights and hands-on experience. Some notable projects include:

- [Credit card default classification](https://github.com/saichandureddy/Credit-Card-Default-Classification): In this project, developed SVM, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression machine learning models from scratch to classify the risk of credit card holders fall into default. Performed statistical analysis to perform feature engineering and visualized the insights through seaborna dn matplotlib libraries.
- [Flight Price Prediction](https://github.com/saichandureddy/Flight-Price-Prediction): In this project we analyzed the flight prices dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to dicover the hidden patterns, outliers, correlated features that affecting the price. Created visualizations to compare the features and its realtion to target variable.
- [Liver Cirrhosis Classification](https://github.com/saichandureddy/Liver-Cirrhosis-Classification): Analyzed th patient health records and classified the stages liver disease in the patient. Implemented Random forest, decision tree, logistic regression machine learning models to classify the different levels of risk of being effected by liver disease.
